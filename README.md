## How to setup:
Run `install.py`
Put your token in `config.py`
Run `main.py`

## Notice:
With the new version of `discord.py-self`, for some reason it takes a while to send commands in DMs/Group chats but after doing it once it acts normal again.

# Selfbot info
- `93` commands
- `7` categories
- The version is `3.0` because it used to be private
