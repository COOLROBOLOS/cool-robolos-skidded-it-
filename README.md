## How to setup:
- Download Python
- Run `install.py`
- Put your token and other optional info in `config.py` 
- Run `main.py`

## Notice:
- With the new version of `discord.py-self`, for some reason it takes a while to send commands in DMs/Group chats but after doing it once it acts normal again.

# Selfbot info
- `93` commands
- `7` categories
- The version is `3.0` because it used to be private

### Author info
- Developed by me and me only
- The only commands that aren't mine are `eval` and `hypesquad` (hypesquad is from [Zeenode](https://github.com/zeenode/selfbot) and the eval command is from some youtube tutorial vid)
